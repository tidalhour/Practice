Will go on a 4 day break because I have some reallyyy important business to manage for the duration I'll be gone. Also will be finishing some overdue school works and just fix my life in general, haha.

Don't worry, once I go back I'll try to make up for the lost streak by doing more practices, especially on arrays and multidimensional arrays, and still try to commit if I can.
I'll be returning on Monday, October 28, 2024.
