Some of the prompts are from
- ChatGPT: I ask for a certain output on a certain Java syntax and redo it in code.
- Google: Lots of sample practice exercises can be found on Google, I just "steal" some of them.
- w3resource: I highly recommend this, its a good source of practice activities and has flowcharts/visualizations and solutions.

...and many more.
